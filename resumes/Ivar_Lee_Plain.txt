About Me

I am a Web Developer in Seattle interested in solving problems and answering questions by leveraging data. I enjoy the process of bringing ideas to life, whether it's through a full stack web application or some other creative endeavor. Curiosity drives me to explore and continue to learn. I am at my best when working with a team to solve problems. As a former member of the package operations team at UPS I understand the necessity for collaborative decision making, accuracy, and timeliness.

Education

General Assembly 2016
I participated in a 12 week immersive program where I studied a range of web development topics. I had the opportunity to work with people from different fields and build awesome things. This course put me closer to reaching my goal of becoming a Web Developer. Since the class recently ended I've been working on my personal projects, sharpening my skills, and seeking opportunities.
