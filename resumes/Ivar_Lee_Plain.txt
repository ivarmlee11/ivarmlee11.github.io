About Me

I am a web developer in Seattle interested in solving problems and answering questions by leveraging data. I enjoy the process of bringing ideas to life, whether it's a full stack web application or some other creative endeavor. Curiosity drives me to explore and continue to learn. I am at my best when working with a team to solve problems. As a former member of the package operations team at UPS I understand the necessity for collaborative decision making, accuracy, and timeliness.
